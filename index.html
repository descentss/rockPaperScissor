          Can't decide on where to eat? Try playing a quick game of
          rock-paper-scissors! It's a classic game where you and your friend
          choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined
          by the rules of the game. Play up to five rounds and keep score, and
          whoever wins gets to choose where to eat. It's a fun way to make a
          decision and adds a little excitement to your meal plans!
